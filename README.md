# _"Create Culture Space"_ Telegram-bot 

## 1. Project overview


This Telegram-bot helps people: <br>
* to book workplaces at coworking place <br>
* to book a particular time in meeting rooms <br>
* to keep users entrance tickets (there is users profiles) <br>

Also, I would like to say about benefits for *Create Culture Spase*. Their admins don't need anymore to 
make the bookings by the Google Calendar. Nowadays users do it by themselves through the *Telegram-bot*.
Also, I should say about *Create Culture Space*, their entertainments and Bot. You can find something
interesting using it because they have schedule with activities.
